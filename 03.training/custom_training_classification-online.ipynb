Deploy the `Model` resource to the `Endpoint` resource.\n","\n","\n","The function takes the following parameters:\n","\n","- `deployed_model_display_name`: A human readable name for the deployed model.\n","- `traffic_split`: Percent of traffic at the endpoint that goes to this model, which is specified as a dictionary of one or more key/value pairs.\n","   - If only one model, then specify as **{ \"0\": 100 }**, where \"0\" refers to this model being uploaded and 100 means 100% of the traffic.\n","   - If there are existing models on the endpoint, for which the traffic will be split, then use `model_id` to specify as **{ \"0\": percent, model_id: percent, ... }**, where `model_id` is the model id of an existing model to the deployed endpoint.

In this tutorial, only one instance is provisioned.\n","\n","### Traffic split\n","\n","The `traffic_split` parameter is specified as a Python dictionary. You can deploy more than one instance of your model to an endpoint, and then set the percentage of traffic that goes to each instance.\n","\n","You can use a traffic split to introduce a new model gradually into production. For example, if you had one existing model in production with 100% of the traffic, you could deploy a new model to the same endpoint, direct 10% of traffic to it, and reduce the original model's traffic to 90%. This allows you to monitor the new model's performance while minimizing the distruption to the majority of users.\n","\n","### Compute instance scaling\n","\n","You can specify a single instance (or node) to serve your online prediction requests. This tutorial uses a single node, so the variables `MIN_NODES` and `MAX_NODES` are both set to `1`.\n","\n","If you want to use multiple nodes to serve your online prediction requests, set `MAX_NODES` to the maximum number of nodes you want to use.
